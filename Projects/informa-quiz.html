            <article>
                
                <h3>Background & Brief</h3>
                <p>In the winter of 2018 / 19 I was tasked by <span class="expnd-text-button">Informa Systems</span> <span class="extra-text">Informa System's main software is a feature-heavy LMS targeted at U.S. emergency services, mostly Police. As such, it was decided that a good way to market the main software was to create a completely free multiplayer quiz app. It was envisioned that such an app would be used as a training tool within police academies and the like</span>  to build a quiz app. I was the sole developer and the project was from scratch.</p> 
                
                <p>The brief:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Multiplayer quiz with single quiz master - multiple quiz player relationship.</li>
                    <li>Target platforms (to work together): Android, iOS and Chromebook.</li>
                    <li>Ability to select pre-made quizzes and to create quizzes.</li>
                    <li>Bonus: Single player mode.</li>
                </ul>                
                
                <h3>Completion</h3>
                <p>The prototype was created in full and worked well. The project was unfortunately pulled before going into production due to changing business focus.</p>

                <h3>General</h3>
                <p>This app was a text-based quiz game. Simply read the question and select one of the multiple choice answers:</p>
                <img 
                    class="vertical-screencap-image" 
                    src="../Resources/Images/quiz-app/quiz-app-screenshot.png" 
                    style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                
                <h3>Multiplayer</h3>
                <p> The main focus of the game was the asymmetric multiplayer. One player is the <span class="expnd-text-button">Question Master</span>,<span class="extra-text">The QM choose the questions, settings, and create a session</span> and 1+ other's are <span class="expnd-text-button">Players</span>.<span class="extra-text">Players answer questions when made available. There was no upper player limit</span> The QM then starts the game and dictates the flow:</p>
                <video class="vertical-screencap-video" controls muted>
                    <source src="../Resources/Videos/quiz-app-qm-view.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
                  Your browser does not support the video tag.
                </video>
                <p> All of the other participants are "players". Players join the session via a code the QM would verbally share:</p>
                <video class="vertical-screencap-video" controls muted>
                    <source src="../Resources/Videos/quiz-app-player-view.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
                  Your browser does not support the video tag.
                </video>
                
                
                <h3>Single Player</h3>
                <p>Another mode included was Single Player which was player vs <span class="expnd-text-button">the clock</span>. <span class="extra-text">The player would choose a question-set and aim to finish this as fast as possible. If an incorrect answer was selected it would add a time penality and the player would have to choose again until they selected the correct answer</span> Their time was saved to a leaderboard and the player could share a picture of their score via native options.</p>
                
                <h3>Question Creator</h3>
                <p>This featured allowed for the user to create a question-set and save it locally.</p>

                <p>The app was written in C#, built using <a href="https://unity.com/" target="blank">Unity</a> and the Unity <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="blank">Google Firebase</a> integration. </p>
                <p><u>Unity</u>: This was chosen as the front-end / application framework for prototyping. Although Unity is a heavyweight choice, at the time it was the framework I was the most knowledgeable with as I had just developed a 3D game with it: Cubefall. It was our intention that the project would be recreated using something more suitable post product validation.</p>
                <p><u>Firebase</u>: This was used for the back-end, specifically authentication and database. Firebase has an extremely responsive real-time database, which proved perfect for our multiplayer quiz app where players receiving the question at the same time is key. A further bonus was that this setup meant our quiz sessions had a practically infinite upper player limit as literally thousands can interact with this relational database concurrently.</p>

            <h2><a style="color: rgb(10, 145, 190)">#</a> Lesson 1: Original Ideas</h2>
            <article> 
                <div class="pull-quote-container">
                    <p class="pull-quote">I have no spur to prick the sides of my intent, but only vaulting ambition, which o’erleaps itself and falls on th’ other.</p>
                    <p class="pull-quote-author">MacBeth - Act 1, Scene 7</p>
                </div>
                <p>Even though the brief was completed in full and all deadlines were met, the app was still cancelled. I think there is a lesson to be learned from the story of how the app started and how it ended.</p>
                <p>The app started as a marketing tool for the businesses’ LMS software <em>InformaOne</em>. Our target user was an instructor at a police or firefighter academy. They would use our software as a fun tool to liven up dry classes, and in return this would generate interest in our main software.</p>
                <p>During development, scope crept. We used the app “Kahoot” as a reference as it is a best-of-class example for multiplayer quiz apps. Kahoot is a fantastically successful company, valued north of $300m. This starts the inevitable thoughts: “if our base app does the same thing, why not try take a slice of the same pie?”. We slowly transitioned from a marketing tool into a Kahoot competitor.</p>
                <p>The need for a question-set creator was there from the start, but now it we would need some kind of sharing platform, which would require some kind of curation system, which requires some kind of rating system. <em>Some kind</em> is the indicator of scope creep.</p>
                <p>Alongside these new features, the app, which was still technically a prototype, was far off the polished UI and UX of Kahoot. This was ultimately why it was cancelled as the business decided it would be too costly to compete with the much larger, much better funded Kahoot studio.</p>
                <p>The app was cancelled for a reason that shouldn’t have applied to it. I can’t criticise management in this decision as I was equally complicit: the thought of being in at the ground floor of a potentially multi-million dollar app was just too inviting. Management and I bounced ideas off each other and said yes without properly thinking through what yes really meant. It’s easy to say “yes” today, but hard to implement “yes” tomorrow, and even hard to make a project successful when twenty “yesses” has cornered your product.</p>
                <p>I have thought of many questions now that would have been useful to ask myself back then, but for the sake of memorability I think of just this one: What is the intention of this new pivot in relation to the original concept? Just answering this one question helps you retrace how you got from 0 to where you are now, which grounds you regarding your next potential step.</p>

            <h2><a style="color: rgb(84, 97, 219)">#</a> Lesson 2: Prototyping</h2>
            <article>
                <div class="pull-quote-container">
                    <p class="pull-quote">Kill your darlings.</p>
                    <p class="pull-quote-author">Various authors</p>
                </div>
                <p>When I look at the app now, approximately one year after development stopped, it is much easier for me to judge the UI in an objective way. One thing that has struck me is how some of the UI looks not bad. Not bad UI is not good.</p>
                <p>First, let’s talk about Unity as a UI producing tool. Unity’s UI creator is almost entirely visual, and then manipulated in script:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each element must be defined by creating and sizing boxes, anchoring them to other elements and nesting them inside hierarchies.</li>
                    <li>Colors and styles are manually defined, element by element.</li>
                    <li>Animations are created by manually lerping transforms.</li>
                    <li>Allowing the player to interact with the UI, having dynamic text etc involves a lot of “wiring up”: a manual process of writing specific controller scripts, defining variables in these scripts and dragging and dropping in real-world elements. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Unity UI system is comparable to a visual prototyping tool, except you never move on from it when you’re done prototyping! As such, a developer is even more incentivized to keep their prototype simple within Unity as adding a small amount of complexity compounds faster than in more traditional app development tools.</p>
                <p>This was a lesson I did not fully heed during the app’s development. What I was building was a prototype for a real-time multiplayer quiz: at the heart of this task is a technology that I had not worked with (Google Firebase Real-time database). The prototype’s UI should have been as basic as possible until I had made this technology work. Instead, I straddled the costly grey-zone of “alright UI” which made dealing with this core, project-deciding issue a longer and more complex process.</p>
                <p>The even more perplexing thing of this “alright UI” is how I knew it would be thrown and redone for production, yet I persisted. I’ve come to believe that this is a symptom of final product thinking: you are so sure that the final product will be good that you don’t consider that any steps to getting to that final product may not succeed. In other words, “why not make it feel more real, because everything will be fine, right?”. </p>
                <p>Given distance, we all know that things may not be alright; no project is ever a sure shot. This optimistic frame of mind is easy to succumb to when you are passionate about something and don’t want it to fail. However, the healthy approach is to treat each project with objectivity, to try your best on each project-critical challenge, but admit when it won’t work. As such, you should be proud of boring UI in your prototype, it means you have your feet on the ground.</p>
